Coding Exercise

Write a class or library in a language of your choice which simulates a vending machine.  
The implementation should track current stock levels of the machine, and the interface should include methods to restock the machine and to purchase an item.  When a purchase is made, the machine should dispense the correct change.  Assume the machine operates in Sterling (i.e. current UK pounds and pence denominations including the £2 coin down to one penny), and that it holds a sufficient number of coins that it won’t run out of change.  Document any design decisions and assumptions you make about the specification, and show your program works by providing either unit tests or a simple console or web interface.  You should look to demonstrate a good understanding of how to use the language you choose effectively, and that you can confidently apply language constructs, design patterns and the principles of computer science in order to develop clear, maintainable code.  You should try not to spend more than 1.5 - 2 hours on the problem. Provide comments on how you would complete or improve your program.
